# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Unfortunately, only the latest release is getting security updates. This is because QuickExtension lacks a versioning system, nor does it need one.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Standard GitHub workflow -- click _"Security"_, then "_Report vulnerability_", do your thing, and send it off! Response times are variable but they usually happpen in less than a week, maybe more if I'm really busy.
