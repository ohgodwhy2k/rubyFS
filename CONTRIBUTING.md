## Branch naming

To keep our Git history clean and easily searchable, all branches must follow the `type/issue-id-description` convention.

### Prefixes (Type)

- **`feature/`**: For new functionality. (e.g., `feature/GH-20-add-settings-panel`)
- **`fix/`**: For bug fixes. (e.g., `fix/GH-15-uncaught-typeerror`)
- **`chore/`**: For maintenance or tooling updates. (e.g., `chore/update-rollup-plugins`)
- **`refactor/`**: For code structure changes without functional changes. (e.g., `refactor/simplify-registration-logic`)

**Always include a GitHub issue number (`GH-XX`)** if the change relates to a logged bug or feature request.
